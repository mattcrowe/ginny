### Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature you would like to see added to Ginny, you may create an issue on GitHub with `[Request]` in the title. The feature request will then be reviewed by [@crowefoote](https://github.com/crowefoote).

## Coding Guidelines

Ginny follows the [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) and [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) coding standards. In addition to these standards, below is a list of other coding standards that should be followed:

- Namespace declarations should be on the same line as `<?php`.
- Class opening `{` should be on the same line as the class name.
- Function and control structure opening `{` should be on a separate line.
- Interface and Trait names are suffixed with `Interface` (`FooInterface`) and `Trait` (`FooTrait`) respectively.
