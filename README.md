Ginny: MVC Generation Tool
=================

This is very much a work-in-progress.

My vision is to have a resource that can use a schema file to generate not just models, views and controllers,
 but also migrations, seeders, and unit tests. It's intended to be flexible so that a developer could swap in pre-made
  schemas or use their own, like-wise for generator logic and templates.

Additional information to follow.
